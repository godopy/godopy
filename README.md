# GodoPy (WIP)

This repository contains the [Python](https://www.python.org) bindings for the [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org)'s GDExtensions API. Please note that this project is under **active and rapidly changing development**—expect significant changes and improvements as we work toward a stable version!

## 🚧 Current Status

## Features

GodoPy offers support for both **Extension** and **Script** languages with Python.

- **Extension Language Support:** GodoPy allows you to implement custom Godot types, such as custom Resources, Resource loaders and savers, custom Script languages, and anything else supported by the GDExtension API.

- **Python Script Language Support:** At this stage, GodoPy provides the ability to use Python as a scripting language within Godot, much like GDScript or C#. This feature is still being developed and refined, but is already usable in certain scenarios.

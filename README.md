# GodoPy (WIP)

This repository contains the [Python](https://www.python.org) bindings for the [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org)'s GDExtensions API. Please note that this project is under **active and rapidly changing development**—expect significant changes and improvements as we work toward a stable version!

## 🚧 Current Status

> **⚠️ NOTE**  
> GodoPy is actively evolving, and while many features are working, there will be ongoing changes to the API, features, and functionality. This repository is suited for early adopters, developers, and contributors.

## Features

GodoPy offers support for both **Extension** and **Script** languages with Python.

- **Extension Language Support:** GodoPy allows you to implement custom Godot types, such as custom Resources, Resource loaders and savers, custom Script languages, and anything else supported by the GDExtension API.

- **Python Script Language Support:** At this stage, the Python scripting feature is still under development and not yet fully usable. Once complete, it will enable the use of Python as a scripting language within Godot, similar to GDScript or C#.

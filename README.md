# GodoPy (WIP)

This repository contains the [Python](https://www.python.org) bindings for the [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org)'s GDExtensions API. Please note that this project is under **active and rapidly changing development**—expect significant changes and improvements as we work toward a stable release!

## 🚧 Current Status

> **⚠️ WARNING**  
> Everything in this project is subject to change. GodoPy is in active development, and the API, features, and functionality will continue to evolve. This is an experimental release, aimed at early adopters, developers, and contributors.

## Features

GodoPy offers support for both **Extension** and **Script** languages with Python.

- **Extension Language Support:** GodoPy allows you to implement custom Godot types, such as Resource loaders, custom Script languages, and anything supported by the GDExtension API.
  
- **Python Script Language Support:** At this early stage, GodoPy provides the ability to use Python as a scripting language within Godot, much like GDScript or C#. This feature is in development and will evolve as the project progresses.
